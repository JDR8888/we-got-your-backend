Database Models
Your database should contain the following four models, including the requirements listed for each model:

# Category
- id: (Integer) allowNull false, PK auto increment
- category_name: String, Doesn't allow null values

# Product
- id: Integer, no null, PK auto increment
- product_name: String, not null
- price: Decimal, no null, validate for decimal value
- stock: int not null default val = 10, validate that is numeric
- category_id: int, references #category.id

# Tag
- id: int not null, PK, auto increment
- tag_name: String

# ProductTag
- id: int not null PK auto increment 
- product_id: int, references #product.id
- tag_id: int, references #tag.id

Associations
You'll need to execute association methods on your Sequelize models to create the following relationships between them:

Product belongs to Category, as a category can have multiple products but a product can only belong to one category.

Category has many Product models.

Product belongs to many Tag models. Using the ProductTag through model, allow products to have multiple tags and tags to have many products.

Tag belongs to many Product models.
